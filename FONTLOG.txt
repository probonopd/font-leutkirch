Leutkirch font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Leutkirch font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Leutkirch fonts 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

The Leutkirch typeface is based on Seoul Namsan Condensed.

Seoul Namsan is the official sans serif typeface family of Seoul city.
It aims to increase Seoul's identity and brand value, and its design
succeeds in evoking the spirit of classical scholars and has beautiful
negative spaces. The shapes echo the structure of Hanok (한옥), a
traditional form of Korean housing which has beautiful curves in the
traditional roof tiles.
